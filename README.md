# pandas-challenge

This repository contains the code and files for the Data Analytics Bootcamp pandas challenge homework.  Ior this challenge, I read in a csv file (purchase_data.csv) which contains user purchase data for a game call Heroes of Pymoli.  The data was imported as a pandas data frame and the challenge consisted of using pandas to filter and aggregate the data to generate a report on the analysis of players and purchasing trends.  The report, and underlying code, are in the file: heroesofpymoli_main.ipynb. Data trends are in the file: data_trends.txt
